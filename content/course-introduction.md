# Universell utforming av digitale tjenester
*EU Accessibility Regulations and Digital Compliance*

## Course Introduction

Digital products and services are increasingly regulated. In the EU and Norway, accessibility is not optional — it's law. Organizations that fail to meet accessibility requirements face enforcement action, fines, and exclusion from public procurement.

This module provides an introduction to how we design digital products to work for everyone, and meet legal requirements.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain how WCAG, EN 301 549, and EU legislation connect to Norwegian law
- Evaluate designs against WCAG 2.2 success criteria relevant to interaction designers
- Identify accessibility barriers through manual testing techniques
- Apply inclusive design patterns using WAI-ARIA and established component conventions
- Recognize how adjacent regulations — GDPR, the AI Act, the Digital Markets Act, and dark pattern prohibitions — shape design decisions

## Why This Matters

Accessibility is often taught as a technical skill for developers. But most accessibility failures originate in design decisions made before a single line of code is written. As interaction designers, you specify the requirements that developers implement. Understanding accessibility at this level means you can prevent barriers rather than remediate them.

The regulatory landscape is also expanding. The European Accessibility Act extends requirements to private sector products and services from 2025. Designers who understand this environment will be better positioned professionally — and will create better products.

## Module Structure

The module runs over two weeks with six lecture days. We combine regulatory foundations with hands-on practice: you'll test real Norwegian services, work with assistive technologies, and apply what you learn to concrete design scenarios. Assessment is a written exam on the final day.
